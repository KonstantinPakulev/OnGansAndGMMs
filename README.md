# OnGansAndGMMs

The project is based on the paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.12462

The proposal for the project may be found here: https://www.overleaf.com/read/xgkqshgyqngd (Richardson  and  Weiss2018)

## Proposal summary

For convinience main milestones and list of experiments to be conducted is listed below (note that this list maybe changed in future):

Here we will briefly describe the goals of the project as well as important milestones.

At first, we want to reproduce the key experiments of Richardson  and  Weiss2018:
- Implement Voronoi cells based statistic test
- Implement Mixture of Factor Analysers (MFA) for data distribution modeling
- Compare MFA and GANS using statistic test proposed in paper, IS and FID on CelebA dataset.

There is also a number of interesting experiments, which can be conducted:
- Reproduce visual insights into the mode collapse problem
- Compare the ability of latent variables of GANs and GMMs to describe data manifold.
- Replace Mixture of FA with Mixture of PPCAs and compare the difference
